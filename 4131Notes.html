		The HTML DOM is a standard for how to represent/store, get,
		change, add, or delete HTML elements.
		The HTML DOM defines the objects and properties of all HTML
		elements, and the methods(interface) to access them.
		Everything is a Node, when HTML elements become objects, attributes
		are turned into properties. Very similar, however, attrivutes are a 1 to 1 connection that represents the 
		initial state of the element and are always strings, while properties represent the current value
		of the element
		You can modify the webpage by modifying the DOM through Javascript
		Javascript can :
		Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
		React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses
		JavaScript Hoisting – in JavaScript, a variable can be used
		before it has been declared, not putting var when declaring and assigning 
		a variable makes it global. You must use var when declaring variable

		A closure allows a function to be able to hold onto certain values
		,such as free variables, which are variables that are defined locally, but 
		exist within an enclosed scope. Without a closure, these variables are 
		set to references, so when it is used later on, the value of the variable
		changes to what it was last modified to. 
		Closure will keep a record of all the current scope it is wrapped in, so in a for loop
		without another closure to limit the scope, the changes made to any variable in the scope
		will permeate to other closures made in the scope. We want to create a scope where
		there is no change the variable, so putting a new scope inside the for loop will save the values of
		the current loop, since the values are encasulated in a scope
		If you define a closure within a scope, and the value of the variables that the closure
		saves does not change within the scope the closure is in, then the value of the variables will not change either 
		outside scope of the closure should be static, no chance to change
	</div>
	<div class = "mbp">
		Event Listeners are added via javascript. Will add the event handler to the button by getting the id of the button.
		Based on the event the event listener is listening for, the event handler will execute
		a function. Make sure that the getElementById is used after all elements in the DOM have been loaded in
		or else it may return null, race condition. The event handler is the function that is called after
		the event has been detected. 
		The event can be captured either in the bubbling phase or the capture phase. 
		Set useCapture to true if you do not want bubbling, like an event especially for a child element
		Bubbling makes sure the child element's event is triggered first rather than capturing, where the 
		parent's event is triggered first
		<br>
		Examples of Events and Event handlers are
		
			click		onClick
			change		onChange
			focus		onFocus
			load		onLoad
			mouseover	onMouseOver
			select		onSelect
		 <br>
		 Event travels from the DOM to the target element, triggers on the target element,
		 and sends the response back up to the DOM, when an even is fired onto an element,
		 it is delivered onto the element's event handler, then the element's parent event handler, 
		 etc. To make sure it only happens on the element you want, 
		
		Remove an event listener by calling removeEventListener
		with the same arguments that you passed to addEventListener to register the event handler

		- TCP/ip is the network that http sends request and reponses through. 
		- IP obtains the address and TCP guarantees delivery of data to that address.
		- TCP is the transport protocol, IP is the network PROTOCOL, dealing with addressing and routing
		- DNS converts IP to URL
		Consists of 2 protocols, TCP and UDP
		- TCP is responsible for establishing connection between 2 machines, then transporting
		  all the information from one device to another 
		- TCP is reliable, acknowledgement is expected, will resend if not recieved by receiver
		- UPD is not reliable, but is used when reliability is not critical
		
		- IP is a network layer protocol, each machine in an IP network
		  has an ip address, and the IP software is responsible for routing a message
		  from the source IP to the destination IP
		- In an ip machine, TCP supports many sockets and ports. 
		- In an IP network, each machine has an IP address
